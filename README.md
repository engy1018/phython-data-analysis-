This is aproject i did for my master research paper , where I build a recommendation system for a movies dataset.

- Data was taken from the movielens dataset
-The Project Write-up is published on SSRN
- The model uses both; content-based filtering techniques and collaborative filtering techniques.
- Algorithms Used : K-Nearest Neightbours, TF-IDFS, Singular Value Decomposition Model (SVD), Alternatining least Square (ALS)
Optimised the SVD & ALS model.
